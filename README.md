## IBKR ALGOs

This repository contains an **automated trading systems** integrated with **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**. The systems are designed for **live algorithmic trading** and includes the following key features:

## Features

- **IBKR Connectivity**: Connects to IBKR TWS/Gateway with retry logic for stable connections.
- **Market Data Handling**: Retrieves **live market data** and tracks price history to calculate **volatility** and other trading metrics.
- **Risk Management**: Implements strategies to manage risk, including **position sizing**, **stop losses**, and **trailing stops**.
- **Order Execution**: Places **orders** with retry logic, including **trailing stop orders**, and handles **real-time trading**.
- **Real-Time Position Monitoring**: Monitors open positions in real-time and ensures the execution of strategies.
- **Alerting & Notifications**: Sends **email or HTTP alerts** based on trading events and system status.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devshimi/IBKR-ALGOs.git
cd IBKR-ALGOs
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```env
IB_HOST=127.0.0.1
IB_PORT=7497
IB_CLIENT_ID=1
PORTFOLIO_SIZE=100000.0
ALLOC_PCT=0.10
STOPLOSS_PCT=0.30
TRAILING_STOP_PCT=0.10
POSITIONS_FILE=positions.json
SCHEDULER_INTERVAL=300
MAX_RETRIES=3
RETRY_DELAY_MS=500
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=50
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=1000
```

## Usage

### 1. **Run the trading system**:
   Type the filename to run and execute the script in your terminal
    
### 2. **Interactive Command Loop**
Once the system is running, you can interact with it using the following commands:
- `run`: Execute the active trading strategy using live market data.
- `back`: Run backtesting simulation (not yet implemented).
- `risk`: Trigger dynamic risk management check to assess portfolio risk.
- `advanced`: Execute advanced options strategies (manual trigger).
- `exit`: Disconnect from IBKR and exit the system.

## How It Works

### **IBKR Connectivity**
- The system connects to IBKR using the **IBClient** from the `ibapi` crate.
- It ensures connectivity with retry logic for stable operations.
- Market data subscriptions are managed using `MktDataSubscription` and handled asynchronously.

### **Market Data Handling**
- The system retrieves **real-time market data** and tracks price history using a **deque buffer** to compute **volatility** (standard deviation).
- The **volatility** is calculated over a sliding window of recent price data.

### **Risk Management & Order Execution**
- The system applies risk management strategies such as **stop-loss** and **trailing stops** based on configurable parameters.
- Orders are placed with retry logic using **market orders**. The system supports automatic execution with real-time data updates.
- **Rate limiting** ensures that the system adheres to API request limits.

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
- The system monitors open positions in real-time, adjusting trades when stop-loss or trailing stop conditions are met.
- **Alerts** are triggered for important trading events such as order fill or failures.
